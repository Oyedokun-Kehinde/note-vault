      "content": "One of the greatest honours God has given man is the privilege to work. Work was not a curse that came after the fall; it was part of God’s original design. Before sin ever entered the world, the Bible says, “The LORD God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.” (Genesis 2:15). From the beginning, man was created to labour — to create, to build, to steward, to add value. There’s a sacred dignity in labour. To wake up every morning and have a place where you commend your energy — that is honourable. To have something that demands your attention, your creativity, your skill — that is purpose in motion. Work gives meaning to life, and diligence crowns it with fruit.\n",
